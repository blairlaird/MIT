Eye Exercise

## Description
The Eye Exercise project is an interactive web application where on-screen eyes follow the movement of the user's cursor. It showcases the use of JavaScript to create responsive and attention-grabbing web elements, enhancing user engagement through interactive design.

## How to Run
